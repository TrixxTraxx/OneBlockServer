This is a plugin for a Server where you can play One Block Skyblock like shown here: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCA9yS0esA8zY8QnZTVFOiNQ
When someone wants to finish this, contact me on discord: TrixxTraxx#8555
I can host it if someone is willing to finish it.

to work on this you need to setup advanced slime world Manager: https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/advanced-slimeworldmanager.87209/
use paper version #173 or lower (before the "chunk rewrite commit") for swm to work
